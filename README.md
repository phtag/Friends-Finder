# Friends-Finder

Week 13 homework assignment


### Overview
This project uses Node.js and Express to create a server application to host users searching for friends that match their preferences. It provides a web-based frontend where users can fill out their name, provide a picture of themselves and answer a survey of questions and submit this information to search for the friend that most closely matches their survery question answers. After submitting their information, users are provided with the name and picture of the friend most closely matching their preferences.

The server code is implemented in node.js using Express. The server services both html and api routes. The html routes send html files to the client browser based on user actions.

The api serves routes for:
* getting a JSON formatted list of all possible friends on the site
* posting information about the current user

### Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to create a node.js server application using Express that services different routes from a client. In particular, the server services both GET and POST requests from clients as well as providing different routes for sending web pages to the client.
